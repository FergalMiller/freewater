Welcome to my public GitHub repo. 

This repo contains small demonstratory projects that I have personally created.
Each project has a single README file explaining what technical achievements and skills the project demonstrates.

The projects displayed attempt to use as few 3rd party tools, libraries, and APIs as possible in an attempt to demonstrate my own personal competence as best I can. Any 3rd party tools used will be mentioned and their affect on the project explained in the README of each directory.
