Welcome to my GitHub repo for university assignments. 

This repo contains small projects that I have undertaked whilst at university.
Each project has a single README file explaining what technical achievements and skills the project demonstrates.

Please remember that the projects displayed here are undergraduate work and do not reflect the full extent of my knowledge, and certainly not the full capabilities of my software development skills to date.

The projects displayed attempt to use as few 3rd party tools, libraries, and APIs as possible in an attempt to demonstrate my own personal competence as best I can. Any 3rd party tools used will be mentioned and their affect on the project explained in the README of each directory.
